The Yahoo! Distribution of Hadoop is the version of Hadoop that Yahoo
runs on its clusters. We contribute all of work into the trunk of
Hadoop, but generally don't accept patches except via Hadoop.

h2(#involved).  Getting involved

Please contribute all patches and improvements to 
"Apache Hadoop":http://hadoop.apache.org. Apache focuses on building active
communities of developers working on common projects, including Hadoop.

h2(#github). GitHub

You are also welcome to fork or clone the "Yahoo! Distribution of
Hadoop":http://github.com/yahoo/hadoop-common, which is based on the
Apache distribution.
