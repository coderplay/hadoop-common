title: Yahoo! Distribution of Hadoop
---

Apache Hadoop is a framework for processing large datasets (terabytes
to petabytes) on large numbers of computers (up to 4000) and includes
the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and a MapReduce computation
framework. Yahoo has been the leading contributor to Hadoop since it
split out of Apache Lucene and has been the primary motivator pushing
Hadoop to ever larger scales.

h2(#why).  Why Another Distribution of Hadoop

Yahoo!(tm) runs some of the largest Hadoop clusters and spends the
most effort to test Hadoop at scale, therefore users asked for the set
of patches that we deploy. To satisfy that demand, we released the
Yahoo!  Distribution of Hadoop. We believe this is the best tested and
most stable version of Hadoop.

Yahoo! does not generate revenue from selling Hadoop-based products or
consulting services. Hadoop is business critical to Yahoo!  and is our
primary data analysis platform. We currently have over 36,000
computers running Hadoop in many clusters. Those clusters are used for
science as well as production jobs.
